## Hi there 👋

I'm Hugo, a software developer with a strong focus on **mobile development** and a passion for crafting robust, efficient, and scalable applications. My journey spans across **iOS (Swift, Objective-C)**, **Android (Kotlin, Java)**, and **C-family languages**, with deep expertise in the **Apple ecosystem**. Beyond mobile, I've expanded into **Web3 development, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, and network theory**.

### 🚀 What I Do
- **Mobile Development:** Primarily iOS (Swift, Objective-C), but also experienced in Android (Kotlin, Java).
- **Software Architecture:** Building maintainable and scalable applications.
- **Tech Leadership:** Mentoring teams and leading development efforts.
- **Web3 Development:** Exploring blockchain-based solutions.
- **AI & RAG Systems:** Enhancing knowledge retrieval and contextual AI responses.
- **Mathematical Curiosity:** Currently diving into **network theory and topology**.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- **Advanced mathematics & network dynamics**.
- **Optimizing hardware (like mice on Kali Linux 🤖).**
- **Decentralized applications and AI-powered systems.**

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, Java, C, C++, Python
- **Mobile:** UIKit, XML-based Android UIs (no Jetpack Compose!)
- **Web3 & AI:** Solidity, Rust (beginner), RAG pipelines
- **Backend & Other:** Python, Bash, some JavaScript
- **Testing:** Unit tests in Gherkin (Given-When-Then)

### ✨ Beyond Tech
- **Music:** Jazz drummer & baroque guitarist.
- **Sailing & Writing:** Transitioning towards a nomadic life on a boat ⛵.
