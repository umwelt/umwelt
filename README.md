## Hi there 👋

I'm Hugo, a software developer with a strong focus on **mobile** and **Web3** development. My background spans **iOS (Swift, Objective‑C)**, **Android (Kotlin, Java)**, and **C‑family languages**, and I have recently moved into **blockchain engineering** with a focus on **smart contracts, decentralized applications, and secure asset tokenization**.

### 🚀 What I Do
- **Web3 Development:** 
  - Smart contracts in Solidity for EVM‑based networks.
  - Current work on **Oncoming Network** using the **Camino network** for tokenizing real‑world assets.
  - Integration of smart contracts with TypeScript/React frontends and Node.js/GraphQL backends.
  - Web3 tooling: Hardhat, Ethers.js, contract testing and deployment.
- **Full‑Stack Engineering:** Building end‑to‑end dApps with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and GraphQL.
- **Mobile Development:** Extensive iOS experience with Swift and Objective‑C, plus Android in Kotlin and Java.
- **Software Architecture:** Designing secure, scalable systems with strong typing and maintainable structures.
- **AI & RAG Systems:** Implementing knowledge retrieval pipelines to enhance AI responses.
- 
### 🧠 LLM Customization
- **Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT):** Building domain-specific models that combine retrieval-augmented generation with fine-tuning to improve contextual accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
- **Text-to-SQL Pipelines:** Implementing natural language interfaces for databases, enabling users to query structured data through conversational prompts. Includes query generation, optimization, and execution with validation layers.
- **Integration:** Deploying these capabilities into existing platforms with API endpoints, secure access controls, and scalable cloud infrastructure.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Multi‑chain deployment strategies and bridging.
- Token standards (ERC‑20, ERC‑721, ERC‑1155) and compliance in regulated environments.
- Secure signing, wallet integration, and transaction optimization.
- Graph theory and network topology applied to blockchain consensus and routing.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Solidity, Swift, Objective‑C, Kotlin, Java, C, C++, Python, Rust (beginner)
- **Web3:** Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, web3.js, IPFS
- **Backend:** Node.js, GraphQL, Python, Bash
- **Frontend:** React, Redux, Chakra UI, Material UI
- **Infrastructure:** AWS, serverless microservices
- **Testing:** Gherkin (Given‑When‑Then), contract testing with Hardhat/Chai

### ✨ Beyond Tech
- Jazz drummer and baroque guitarist.
- Transitioning to a nomadic life at sea while continuing software projects.
