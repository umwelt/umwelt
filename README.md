# Hi there 👋  

I'm **Hugo**, a **technical founder and systems architect** working across **Web3**, **AI**, and **mobile ecosystems**.  

Founder of **KODE** and **BOGOWI**, I design and deploy **interoperable systems** that connect on-chain assets, local networks, and real-world use cases.  
My focus is on **architecture, governance, and applied decentralization** — building systems that are technically sound and socially relevant.

## ⚙️ Core Domains  

### 🧩 Web3 & System Architecture  
- Architect of the **BOGOWI Ecosystem** on the **Camino Network**, integrating NFTs, loyalty tokens (BOGO), and DAO-driven conservation funding.  
- Smart contract design for **compliant real-world token flows** and **interoperable multi-contract systems**.  
- Definition of **wallet SDKs**, node orchestration, and off-chain API bridges.  
- Data architecture for **hybrid on/off-chain environments** and traceable event streams.  

### 🤖 AI & Knowledge Infrastructure  
- Design of **Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT)** pipelines for contextual AI systems.  
- Implementation of **semantic data layers** and **text-to-SQL** interfaces for verifiable decision support.  
- Focus on **AI transparency**, **data provenance**, and **graph-based retrieval** in decentralized settings.  

### 📱 Mobile & Frontend Systems  
- Direction and architecture for **cross-platform wallet apps** built in **React Native** with native iOS/Android modules.  
- Integration of blockchain identity, credential storage, and **local-first UX** principles.  
- Experience with secure persistence, offline data sync, and modular API design.  

### 🌐 BLE & IoT Networks  
- Creator of **BOGOWI_BLE**, a distributed Bluetooth beacon network linking cultural landmarks to digital interaction.  
- Combining **3D-printed enclosures**, **BLE payload design**, and **geospatial event routing**.  
- Focus on low-power networking and decentralized data collection.

## 🧭 Current Focus  
- Governance and coordination models for **DAO-based conservation**.  
- **Multi-chain interoperability** and **cross-network wallet integration**.  
- AI-driven infrastructure for decentralized ecosystems.  
- Application of **graph theory and topology** to consensus and network routing.

## 🧠 Stack (Directional Overview)  
**Languages:** Solidity, Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, Python, Rust (learning)  
**Frameworks:** React, React Native, Node.js, GraphQL, Hardhat, Ethers.js  
**Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker, Serverless, Camino Nodes  
**Testing:** Gherkin (Given-When-Then), Jest, Chai
